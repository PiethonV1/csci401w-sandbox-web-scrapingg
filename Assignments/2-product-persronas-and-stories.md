Gregory has recently retired after 4 decades working as UPS driver, and Marry also retired as a secretary from a local university. Among the two of them, they have saved money to ensure their sunset years are financially secured.

However, both Gregory and Marry are not financially intelligent as how to invest and what to invest. So they tend to Hinton.io for stock information.
