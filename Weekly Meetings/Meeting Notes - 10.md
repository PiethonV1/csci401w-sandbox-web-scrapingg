<br>

### 🎯 Meeting Objectives:
- data storage formate
- Database construction
- User interactive Q&A service on Hinton.io

<br>

### 🗒️ Notes:

Reducing size of json files.

DB - Comparing Prof's Demo to Ours
Our's gets too complicated too fast.
Two Tables for Extra Support
	One - Users, Two - Stock (Raw Data)
		Two: Run it on last ten years of data (Adjustable)
			Might need a third table?
		Only a Few Stocks/Markets
		Keep Date, Open, High, Low, Close

Database: SQLite

Dummy Data

Reduce Credentials?

QA:
Full QA is too much: Requires MASSIVE DB to search thru.
Try building a Chatbot instead.
	Solves answering simple questions without requiring massive DB of Data to draw from.
	Customer Focused.

**User Stories: Each sentence has one feature.**
