### 🌟 **Wins**:

*(Celebrate your successes! List major or minor accomplishments, breakthroughs, or moments of clarity.)*

1. **Win 1**: Brief description about the win. *(e.g., "Successfully integrated the login module with the backend.")*

We found our topic. Before the prework, we were nervous about what to work on

2. **Win 2**:

Overall, becoming familiar with each other. It is sometimes awkward meeting new people but this definitely relates to the real world! We were basically thrown into a group without knowing each other and we were able to designate certain people to areas where they are stronger in. Of course we will learn off of each other but the social aspect is a big win.

### 🔄 **Areas for Improvement**:

*(Identify areas where the team can make changes to be more efficient, effective, or collaborative in the next sprint.)*

1. **Improvement 1**: Short description about the area of improvement. *(e.g., "Need to establish clearer communication guidelines for remote work.")*

This is minor, but maybe more directed production to meet deadlines. This isn't too important now since this is the slow startup of the course. This will improve as things kick into 3rd gear.

2. **Improvement 2**: ...
Sunday seems like a good meeting point for us as well as after class on monday. Maybe keep this in the back of our minds for when things start getting "hectic".
